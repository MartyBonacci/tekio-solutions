		<!-- Document content to be featured in each section of the PWP site -->
		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>My PWP site will be one page, and will have the following sections:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Welcome:</strong> A brief introduction that clearly shows the business name and tagline. This welcome will be overlaid on a large background image (to be determined). There will be navigation at the top.<br></li>
			<li><p><strong>About:</strong> This section will provide details about the business, including a brief description about the meaning of the businessâ€™s name. This section will also include details about me, and list my skills along with a small image and links to professional social media profiles: LinkedIn, GitHub.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Services:</strong> This section will highlight the Website Development and Digital Content Creation services offered by the business, including a brief description and iconography of each.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Contact:</strong> This section will have a simple contact form, business mailing address, business email address, and phone number.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>Footer:</strong> Copyright information. (Future: social media links.)</p></li>
		</ul>
