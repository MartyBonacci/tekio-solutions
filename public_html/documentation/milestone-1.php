		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p><strong>Name</strong>: Floyd Platero<br>
			<strong>Age</strong>: 53</p>
		<img src="images/persona-image.jpg" alt="Persona Image Floyd"/>
		<p><strong>Profession</strong>: Tribal Administrator for a Tribal Nation. The Tribal Nation recently acquired grant funding for new and existing tribal programs, and they are looking for ways to improve these programs through the use of technology and websites.</p>
		<p><strong>Technology</strong>: Floyd uses a Windows computer with a Chrome Browser only while at work, and while he can navigate the internet and websites fairly well, he has limited technical knowledge.</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors</strong>: In his browsing of the internet, Floyd has come across useful information for possible tribal programs, and has seen some websites that he likes, but he is cautious about content and information sharing. Floyd tends to be reserved and private, but he's also open to learning more about technology. Floyd spends his days managing business relationships, seeking new opportunities, and constantly looking for ideas to improve his Tribal Nation.</p>
		<p><strong>Needs and Goals</strong>: Floyd needs to find a website developer who can design and create websites for his Tribal Nation's tribal programs. He has an idea about the desired look and feel based on other websites he's come across, but he's not certain he'll be able to properly convey the specifications in a technical manner. Therefore, Floyd wants to be able work with someone he can relate to, someone he can communicate easily with, and someone who understands tribal goings-on. Floyd also wants the work done professionally and with privacy and security concerns in mind. Ideally, Floyd would like to work with a business that will be sensitive to Native cultural identity and that can offer other ideas for improving tribal programs.</p>
		<p><strong>User Story</strong>: As a user, I need to determine whether this business can provide professional, secure, culturally relevant websites and technological solutions for my Tribal Nation.</p>
