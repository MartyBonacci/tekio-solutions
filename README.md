### Milestone 1

#### Feedback 

This is the quality I would expect from an entry level developer reporting to me. Your directory structure is perfect, your HTML is free of any errors or warnings, and you answer the questions laid out in the exercise. I also have a clear understanding of what you want to accomplish with PWP. My only concern is that you are only targeting a single demographic (which is more than okay). That's being said, do you plan on just targeting Tribal Governments, or do you plan to target businesses and individuals. If so remember that targeting different demographics can impact your content strategy and design process. 

#### Grade Tier IV

### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Nice work here. Your wireframes are done to a professional standard, and your content strategy and direction for the page layouts are clear and well defined. The cohesiveness of your wireframes with your content strategy demonstrates a good understanding of design principles and scale. These will provide you with a good "road map" for your upcoming development phase.

The layout ideas here are very compatible with the Bootstrap framework, and I don't forsee any hidden difficulties here. Any time imagery features prominently in a web design, the quality of the images can have a profound impact of the presentation of the site as a whole. Use the highest quality image(s) you can find. [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) has a fairly nice selection of free stock if you need to find something. 

My general recommendation for image file size is 700ish kb max  for a large background image - ideally less. Nothing over 1MB when it comes to  hi-res/Retina compatible versions, which are a bit of an exception case.

Centering the links and toggle button on the navbar should be as easy as switching out some of the built-in Bootstrap margin classes.

[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a great resource for free iconography.

Overall this is a great direction you have here, and it should come together nicely with the Bootstrap Grid. I'm looking forward to seeing your site take shape.

There's a small directory structure change that needs to be made before you begin development - see Edits &amp; Suggestions below. Otherwise everything else looks good.

Build your PWP in a file named `index.php` inside `/public_html`. CSS, images, and JS directories should also be inside `public_html` and siblings to `/documentation`. We won't be using the `/documentation` directory any longer.

If you feel ahead of the curve during your development phase in the coming weeks, have a look at the [PWP Contact Form Doc](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/) for an overview of the Swiftmailer integration.

Nice work. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development!

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Missing closing &lt;/html&gt; tag.
- Move the current `/images` directory inside `/documentation` to keep it isolated from the rest of your project.
